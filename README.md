# Hello ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹!

Welcome to my repo containing all the code for reecegao.dev.

If you actually glance through the code, you'll probably quickly notice that it is a lot of spaghetti code. I never really intended for the `html` and `css` files to get that out of hand. 
But at the time of creating the website, I was unemployed due to a layoff and kinda rushing to finsih some projects to boost my resume and get reemployed so I can pay my bills ðŸ™‚.

I tried following some semblence of "good programming", mainly some things mentioned by front-end youtuber Kevin Powell. It quickly devolved into the rats nest that it is now after getting impatient.
One of these days I'll go back and tidy things up, but for now I should focus on job hunting.

If you like the design and want to take it, feel free to. If you can shuffle through the `html` file successfully, props to you. If you have any questions feel free to ask me! If you do take the design, you don't really
have to credit me, but if you do it'll be greatly apprecateied! At the end of the day it's just cool knowing I helped/inspired someones idea ðŸ™‚
